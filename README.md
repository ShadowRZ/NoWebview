# NoWebview
Say no to webview. Now.

** This project is in the very early stage of development. Use at your own risk. Help needed. **

## Usage
Put the following code into your website (anywhere is OK):

```html
<script src="https://shadowrz.github.io/NoWebview/nowebview/nowebview.js"></script>
```

[Example](https://shadowrz.github.io/NoWebview/nowebview/test.html)

## Compatibility

All modern browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari) should work. No IE compatibility currently.
